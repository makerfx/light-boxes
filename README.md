# Light Boxes
They aren't shadow boxes, they are light boxes! We built these to show off different types of LED lights that can be added into your projects and to help explain different types of control, waterproofing, LED spacing, and more! We plan to hang them on the wall at MakerFX Makerspace and to take them to events. They can also be used as the basis for an intro class on LED project lighting.
